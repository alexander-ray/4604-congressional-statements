# 4604-congressional-statements
Applied Machine Learning (INFO 4604) final project on congressional statements.

driver.py has the main driver code for logistic regression, linear svm, and lda. Also includes some helper functions.

feature_processor.py has the named entity removal functions, as well as a data-retrieval driver function.

scraper.py has the web scraping code, as well as the driver function to split datasets and save to file.

plotting.py has the plotting code for charts seen on the ppt.

Obviously lots of stackoverflow and scikit-learn documentation was used, but all functions based on stackoverflow responses or scikit-learn examples have a link to the relevant code above the function.
